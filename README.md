# FPGA Switch Model

This is a Python application for modelling networking topologies containing some FPGA-based switches which will perform 
compute.

These switches will not be able to perform as fast as the cloud servers they are stepping in for, however they prevent
packets from needing to be sent all the way into datacenters.

This application can be used to model the performance of networks containing these switches.
